Linear Searching takes O(N) time. If you have a sorted array then instead of searching for any number using a linear search approach - searching from left to right you can use a binary
search approach. 
    - Just go to the middle element of this array and chk if it is equal to target.
    - If Greater than target search to the left side vice-versa.
    - At Every Step of Binary Search It's like reducing the View by Half. n -> n/2 -> n/4 -> n/2^k=1 ==> k=Log2N
