We Will Start with very basic Algorithms 
Representation of Graphs - Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix
We will then increase the level of the Algorithms 
    - Topological Ordering
    - MSD
    - Single Shortest Path
Clear Motivation - Learning Path becomes Interesting

Graph Representation Techniques
    - Adjacency List
    - Adjacency Matrix --Uses a lot of Space--
    - Edge List

(1-2-3)-4
<node> {node, weight}

DFS 
Don't take it lightly because DFS is used in many other algorithms which are advanced 
 - Centroid decomposition
 - Heavy light decomposition
DP on Trees also utilizes DFS in one way or the other. 

How DFS actually works? (depth first search)
(start - visited - traverse to node connected - redo all processes)
