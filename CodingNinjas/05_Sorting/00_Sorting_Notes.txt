3 Main Widely Used Sorting Algorithms =>
    - Counting Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort

Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms (in general) => O(N.LogN) 
- Merge Sort

    - Counting Sort, Merge Sort
UnStable Sorting Algorithms -  2_2,2_1,3,5,9
    - Heap Sort, Selection Sort ?
    - Quick Sort

Counting Sort Algorithm
Helpful only in a SmallDomain
Storing the count of every Number? How will this help ....
Make a Frequency Array from minimum to the maximum element and keep on incrementing their count
Find the Min & Max ele in the array and then make your choice of range according to that only!!
Not helpful for =>
    - Very Large Numbers 
    - Fractional Numbers (Storing numbers as Indexes)
    - Negative Numbers (Catch: Shift every number to right by most -ve number)
    - Custom Sorting
